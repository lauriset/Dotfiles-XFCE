Copy the folders where they correspond and put the point to hide them. I don't have them with the point of hiding them because when uploading them Github gave me problems.

### Polybar:
Icons-Left: Icon-1: jgmenu launche Icon-3: left click launche alacrity htop.

### Jgmenu:
In the scripts prepend.csv, change the path that corresponds

### Ncmpcpp:
In the notify scripts, change MUSIC_DIR=$HOME/XXXXX/

I generally use key combinations, in this case windows are closed in Xfce with Ctrl + Q

Excuse my English Enjoy!
